# shsuman

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Astro, Express, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Astro** - The web framework for content-driven websites
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Express** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MySQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses MySQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a MySQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MySQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `npm run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: Axiom observability
- Configure provider accounts: `cd packages/infra && npx alchemy profile edit`
- Dev: npm run dev
- Deploy: npm run deploy
- Destroy: npm run destroy

`alchemy profile edit` stores the selected Axiom, Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && npx alchemy deploy --stage production
```

Alchemy creates a stage-specific Axiom dataset and a least-privilege ingest token. `dev` injects the credentials into the observed apps without writing the token to an env file.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `npm run check`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start all applications in development mode
- `npm run build`: Build all applications
- `npm run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps
- `npm run db:push`: Push schema changes to database
- `npm run db:generate`: Generate database client/types
- `npm run db:migrate`: Run database migrations
- `npm run db:studio`: Open database studio UI
- `npm run check`: Run Biome formatting and linting

## Better Auth Schema Generation

After changing auth plugins or schema options, run `npm run auth:generate` from the project root. The script runs the Better Auth CLI through `varlock run` from the owning app directory, loading the auth instance from `src/services.ts`. Review the schema changes, then use your ORM's migration workflow to apply them.
